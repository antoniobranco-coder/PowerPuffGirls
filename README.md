The app was designed with 2 componets:

1.ShowDetails Component where the detail about the Powerpuff Girls is displayed, as well as the episodes,
separated by season. Each episode card is a link to the episode detail. When the user presses it,
he will be sent to an URL that includes the episode id of the episode card he pressed

2.EpisodeDetails , using the id parameter in the url, the details about each episode are fetched and displayed 

NOTES:
1. I'm not familiar with Redux, reason why I didn't use that technology
2. I had little time to go over this exercice. As I'm not totally proficient in TypeScript
   I decided to use JS instead in order to optimize my time
